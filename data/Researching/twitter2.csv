"Yesterday’s shootings in Atlanta are devastating for the victims’ families and our Asian American community. Over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, Asian American racism has risen and this violent act increases the fear. We must stand together against hate. #StopAAPIHate"
"witness the silence of CS, Information, & Data Science depts who don’t think they have a “diversity problem” bc they enroll lots of Asian-American & international students from Asian nations, but won’t commit $ to antiracist anti-white supremacist, anti-model minority curricula."
With the recent arrest in ATL for the murders of predominantly Asian women i am so tired as an Asian American
Why did one of my posts against Asian American violence get deleted by IG?! Stop censoring it! 
White man shoots up Asian American owned spa parlor and they change the reason for the killings a "sexual addiction" instead of a hate crime......go fucking figure amerikkka
What happened in Georgia was a hate crime against the Asian American community to call it anything else is to be complicit in the violence that’s been increasing against the Asian community for the last year #StopAsianHate
We stand and speak against all these hateful acts against our Asian/Asian-American brothers and sisters. All this hate has to end.
We must stand together against racism and build a safe and just world. My thoughts and prayers goes out to the Asian-American community and anyone who lives in fear because of the rise of hate crime.
We here at Race Through Education stand in support and in solidarity with the Asian American community.
"We are heartbroken over the news of an act of terror against people of color. The murders of 8 people, including 6 Asian American women, in Georgia come on the heels of a hateful surge in violence against the Asian American and Pacific Islander community."
We all gotta start standing up for our Asian and Asian American friends. #StopAsianHate
"VP Harris to the Asian American community: ""We stand with you and understand how this has frightened and shocked and outraged all people, but, knowing the increasing level of hate crime against our Asian American brothers and sisters, we also want to speak out in solidarity."""
Vaccines… economic challenges… Asian-American hate crimes… and the right wants to talk about Cardi B and Dr. Seuss. Make it make sense.
Uplifting Asian-American community today. Everyday. My thoughts and prayers are not enough. Looking for Call to ACTION.
"Ultimately, it does not matter if the victims were sex workers or not or if the suspect's hatred against Asian American women was motivated via his identity as an incel or the pandemic. How we are rendered invisible while being the focus of such hatred is tiresome.#stopasianhate"

"To my Asian & Asian-American friends, students, & colleagues, I am so sorry you have to deal with racist violence, fear of violence, & increased anti-Asian discrimination over the past year. I'm so grateful you are here- you belong here. I hope y'all are feeling okay. "
"To all of my Asian American friends on here, I am thinking of you today. As always, my DMs are open if you want to talk or need to get something off your chest "
"to all my black/poc mutuals, especially asian american, i’m so fucking sorry that white media has the AUDACITY to fucking speak and tell us what the fuck to do as if they aren’t the main source of the issues in this godforsaken country."
"To all my Asian-American friends, you have an ally in me. I will stand by you always."
"To all families and loved ones of those Asian American women, and every other person brutally, cowardly murdered & injured in Georgia, please know that we are filled with sorrow for the pain and suffering inflicted on you. We are deeply regretful."
Thoughts and prayers aren’t going to be helping the Asian American community today.
This should not be hard to understand: the fact that the gunman chose mostly Asian American victims automatically makes it racially motivated.
"This morning as I read the news of what happened in Cherokee County, I'm thinking of the Asian American women in my life who I love and who love me. My wife, her sister, and their mother.  My aunt and my cousins. My friends and neighbors. Fuck white supremacy."
"This Jew stands with the Asian-American community, today and always. #StopAsianHate"
This Asian American hate needs to stop. All of this racism and hate for what.
Thinking of all my Asian American friends who have experienced so much cruelty and racism this year in addition to everything else.
These events don’t happen in a vacuum. This wasn’t a random act of violence. The Asian American women targeted were chosen specifically by the murderer. WORDS MATTER.
these asian american hate crimes in the us ain't it :/ rest in peace
"The reporting about the Atlanta attack on Asian-American women varyingly describes their workplace as “massage parlor,” “nail salon,” and “spa.” Those words all carry very different and loaded meanings."
The official response to the murder of those Asian-American women is enraging
"The murders in Atlanta were a directed act of hate toward the Asian and Asian American community. Plain & simple. It’s infuriating, heart breaking. I am thinking of all my friends and colleagues that are having to go about their lives today with this in the forefront. I see you."
The mass shooting of Asian-American women in Atlanta is breathtakingly awful and upsetting and a consequence of both the endemic racism and misogyny in our world and of how nationalism aggravates all our hatreds.
The hate and violence towards the Asian American community in recent weeks and months is heartbreaking.
the fear i have about being an asian american woman lately hurts my heart and i just.. idk idk idk
The fact people really trying to downplay / completely ignore what’s happening to Asian and Asian American people right now is disgusting! STOP KILLING THEM!!!
The details coming out of the story of the shooting in Atlanta are horrific. Grieving with my Asian and Asian-American siblings. I see you.
"The Asian American community has a special place in my heart and Christian life. My east Asian friends have always given me space, affirmed me in my Asian identity, and shown me what community really looks like."
The Asian American and Pacific Islander community has been overwhelming welcoming to me and many others. It’s disgusting to see Asian hate spread so much #StopAsianHate
the amount of excuse that white people get for doing terrible things infuriates me to my core. Call shit what it is. A man targeted Asian American businesses and murdered 8 people. Hes a terrorist and a murderer. Treat him as such.
"Taking a moment to reflect on the terrible news on deadly and violent attacks on the Asian American community. Racism is a deadly cancer and must be eradicated by us all. Misogyny is also deadly and violent, and a Men’s issue that men need to resolve. We must be better."
Stop saying yt murderers are "mentally ill". That wording uses ableism to prop up white supremacy. It deems able bodied people as incapable of racism or being a white supremacist. That mf Robert Aaron Long knew what he was doing when he killed those Asian American women.
Stop asian American hate!
Standing in solidarity with the Asian American community doesn’t equal anti-blackness. Idk where y’all are getting that logic from.
Standing in solidarity with my Asian American siblings. I’m so sad to see this vile hatred against you in our nation. 
"sorry to overshare but it sucks being single rn. not bc I really care to date anyone exactly, but bc of the “sudden rise” in Asian American WOMEN hate crimes. I’ve always been nervous to do things outside of my apt but now I’m even more on edge. I legit have to give myself pep"
sometimes I doubt myself when planning Asian-American community support because do we *really* deserve the support? The answer is yes and I will not let this country invisibilize us into thinking things are Just Fine as long as we put our heads down and focus on Science
Solidarity with the Asian and Asian-American community. This violence has got to stop.
Solidarity with the Asian American community today. Solidarity. #StopAsianHate
"So I’m filipino but totally white, but like, my mom and aunts and some of my family actually do present pretty fucking filipino; and the fact that literally no one gives a fuck about Asian American hate crimes spiking worries the fuck out of me."
"Six Asian American women were killed in Atlanta today. We're still learning about the motive. However, you should know this: most racist attacks against Asian Americans this past year have targeted women, and Asian American women are on edge. (1/15)"
"My Isolation Companion taught an Asian-American unit to her 4th graders, she didn't sugarcoat the horrible treatment Asian-Americans have received in America, so these kids went into 5th grade knowing the truth. Teach the truth of America. Teach it. Over and over."
my heart is so heavy. sending so much love to the families of the victims who lost their lives in georgia. and to every asian american who have to live in fear that they might be victims of those hate crimes. #stopasianhate
My heart is heavy for the Asian American community. We need to rally behind them and uplift them in such a scary & heart breaking time. #StopAsianHate
"My heart is breaking for all of my Asian American friends, and for this country that's increasingly overrun by violent white supremacists. This has to stop."
"My heart hurts reading more about the Asian & Asian-American women in the Atlanta area as it continues to unfold. I can't imagine the pain of their families and close ones. But I can imagine, and feel, the pain of the AAPI community."
"My heart goes out to the people of Atlanta and the families of those murdered in yesterday’s horrific attacks. As an African American, I know the profound toxicity racism can wreak — and we must continue to stand with the Asian American community and condemn these hateful acts."
"My heart goes out to the asian american community today, what happened was horrific and white Americans once again have to do better protecting ALL minorities from hate crimes."
"Andrew Yang had me at Asian American with innovative business ideas. Then he lost we with Rich Male that tells average Americans how they should work and live, while telling them he'll make it harder to do their job, but easier for corporations to take them."
"Trying to write to Asian American friends, check in, offer what paltry wisdom I have in the wake of the wave of antisemitic violence the last few years have seen. White Supremacy cannot divide us, it only drives us into each other’s arms."
"Today you are going to find out which news outfits hire Asian American writers, editors, tv correspondents and experts - and which do not."
"To the Asian-American community: I know what this feels like. The brokenness. The fear. The inadequacy of anything we can do. I'm so, so sorry."
"To the Asian American community, I am so sorry. I stand with you. I support you. Enough is enough. #StopAsianHate"
"To our Asian American and Pacific Islanders friends, we grieve with you, see you, and will do the work to change the hate."
"To my family and friends who identify as Asian, Asian American and/or Pacific Islander: I love you. I see you. I support you. Your safety and protection is important. Racist words and acts against you will not be tolerated or ignored.  #StopAAPIHate"
I'm starting to wonder if people think "Asian American Pacific Islander" is one specific identity and not two different communities
"I'm scared for my grandparents, Asian-American immigrant workers, Asian women, esp rn. These attackers are fully aware who they ""can target"" and that makes it so much more sickening."
"im aware of what happened in georgia, and just, what can i say. im a kid who doesnt know, im doing my best to learn about the situation, and all i can say is to stay safe, and that i stand with my asian-american followers and i hope that the families of the victims are alright."
"im asian/american and if i see you ppl posting insensitive shit about this you are blocked on sight, already had to do this for some ppl i follow lol. shut up"
I'm angry and sad and scared for my fiancee and all my Asian-American friends. We all need to confront and push back against not just blatant acts of violence but the subtle racism and misogyny we encounter and propagate every day.
(1/2)We stand with the AAPI (Asian American & Pacific Islander) community today and always. The violent acts that were carried out last night in Atlanta are abhorrent and must be addressed. Racism against this community has always existed and we have seen a spike in the last year
"""He's just an incel"" who targeted Asian American women at three of their businesses. It's a fucking hate crime."
"You’re telling me MFs are posting yellow squares in solidarity with the Asian American community,,,,,,babe what does spongebob have to do with this"
You’ll never see an Italian American president either. America is full of hatred and it was just proven yesterday also. The Asian American community was attacked by a white man! Horrible! #StopAsianHate
You would expect a Asian American music label built to give Asian artists a music platform would really use that platform to spread genuine awareness....but no...they wanna post a fucking yellow square which not only is counterproductive but also racist
Prayers goes out to the Asian American community and am truly at a loss of words as to how the media is showing what had happened last night in Atlanta..
Prayers for the Asian/Asian-American community following the horrible hate crime in Atlanta 
post a yellow square? I’m blocking you. Do something for the Asian American community instead. You can make a donation.
"police seriously see a bunch of asian-americans get hate crimed on the daily lately and then a spa with asian-american workers gets shot at and theyre like ""hmmm, wonder what the motive is?"" like how fucking dumb its so obvious"
"Please take some time today to sign petitions, donate, and find ways to show support to our Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. They have contributed so much to our culture, just as all minority groups have, and a crime of hate against them is unforgivable."
"Please stop comparing the Asian American struggle to the Black American struggle. They are both very real and deep-rooted in racism and white supremacy, but they are not the same. Appropriations of BLM slogans and methods are embarrassing."
"please spread awareness and be supportive, my heart goes out to the victims and the aapi (asian american pacific islander) #StopAsianHate"
Please speak on Asian-American issues without being anti-black. Advocacy is not a transaction and discrimination is not a contest.
"Please send love and support to your Asian, and Asian American colleagues, coworkers and friends."
"EVEN if the shooting had some sort of sexual motivation, it's not a coincidence that almost all whose lives were taken were Asian or Asian American and that the person arrested is white. Race is sexualized #racematters #Atlanta #AsianLivesMatter"
"Edit: shop, buy from, and give them a platform to speak up and voice their frustration. I stand with the Asian American Community. #AAPI #StopAAPIHate"
"DONT rt Bc it’s not about me, but last week a friend of a friend, an Asian American woman, was randomly attacked in broad daylight in San Diego. She had to go back to class as she’s a college student right after the attack. We have to denounce violence and mass murder!"
"don't post yellow squares. if you don't know why that's wrong, and why it's incredibly disheartening, please educate yourself. sincerely, an Asian American."
Donald Trump is responsible for all the Asian American violence!!! Calling Covid 19 “Kung Flu” is incredibly racist and he needs to be held accountable!!!
"Don’t forget Asian-American hate crimes are up since Trump’s blame China for everything Covid rhetoric. He fanned this flame of white supremacy. Ultimately it’s America, but don’t leave him out of culpability."
Do we really want to consider handjob stations "part of the Asian American community" #StopAsianHate
Do people realize how small the Asian American community is ? They make up like 6% of the population.
Do not turn Asian American pain into an export for a pro-police state. There will never be accountability nor justice in a system upheld by white supremacy. There will never be healing without the acknowledgment of racist/misogynistic roots.
Do any of my Asian American mutuals have commissions open
"Distance learning today was hard. I had a really bad day and was fed up. I took a breather and started over. I did not, however, target Asian American women in a racially-charged murder. According to Captain Jay Baker, that's just what some people do. #StopAsianHate"

"""He was having a bad day!"" Seriously? That's your justification for someone MURDERING Asian American people? Are you kidding me? The senseless violence against POC NEEDS TO STOP."
"""Hate incidents targeting Asian Americans rose by nearly 150% in 2020, with Asian American women twice as likely to be targeted,"" let that sink in......"
"""but they weren't all Asian American!"" does NOT mean it was not racially motivated. a shooter has motives, but a shooter will shoot to make an impact first and foremost."
"""Asian-American"" is a made up category, not an organic community. Defined from the outside. It's an economic/political/demographic construct rather than a cultural or historical reality."
"""A crime targeting Asian-Americans AND women? That would imply the existence of Asian-American women!"" That's what some of you sound like."
" The U.S. Senate confirmed Katherine Tai as U.S. Trade Representative 98-2. Tai, the daughter of immigrants from Taiwan, served as top Democratic trade counsel for the House Ways and Means Committee. She is the first Asian American and first woman of color to hold the position."
Zelle me or a fellow Asian American today or ur racist 
you are minimizing the experiences of Asian American women by not calling this a hate crime.
Y’all better be donating and spreading awareness to help support the Asian/ Asian-American community 
Wtf does “raising money to stop Asian American hate” even mean. Like when you donate to BLM and donating to stop Asian American hate what are you donating too exactly?
Wishing all of the Asian and Asian American community all the safety in the world.
why can some of y’all not grasp the concept of halsey being pregnant and speaking out against asian-american hate crimes at the same time ?? why is it impossible for her to show her support&activism while carrying ??being pregnant doesnt mean she gets a pass on using her platform

What's with the Asian-American attacks recently?
What is happening to the Asian American community is Real Time proof that the African American community has been telling the truth for the last couple hundred years.
what breaks my heart is how the majority of the hate crimes are towards the asian american elderly. they are literally keeping to themselves and getting attacked for just being asian. that’s VILE. that’s disgusting. they are somebody’s grandparents. #StopAsianHate
went searching to find what resources i can use to learn more and what i can do or share to help for the hate crimes towards the asian/asian american population and went to whats trending and there is not one thing about it. sad how silenced this is. my search continues though!
We support our Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. Take action against racism! Ambivalence towards it only creates a safe haven for hate.
We stand with our Asian American neighbors against hate. The tragedy in Atlanta is just another reminder that we have so much work to do to put in place commonsense gun safety laws and root out the perversive displays of hatred and violence.  #StopTheHate
We stand with all our Asian-American and Asian brothers and sisters against all forms of hate. Racism has no place in this world.

The hate crimes and microaggressions against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders have been rising over the past several years and the recent fatal victimization of eight people including 6 Asian-American women by a gunman in Atlanta must be denounced!

Unpopular opinion but I need to see the Asian American community....actually being American & protesting & fighting for their causes. What rights & causes have in this country have they fought for?
