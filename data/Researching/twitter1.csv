I think it’s very sad to see this orphan like dialogue of Asian Americans about the “Asian American” experience and trying to grasp some sort of commentary about the rise in hate crimes. I don’t even think of myself as an “Asian Australian” I’m simply both Taiwanese & Australian
just thinking about someone hurting my parents or any of my asian american friends hurts and scares me so much. just the thought of someone causing harm to another person based on the color of their skin or based on their race hurts me. what the fuck.

I pray for the day I don’t see an attack on our Asian American elderly.
Asian-American hate crimes are owned by Trump. Trump denigrated immigrants- read nonwhite people. Then he really enjoyed mocking and belittling and blaming Asians for Covid. All after he had spent 5 years promoting violence as a means to deal with people you don’t like. Legacy.

"The violence committed against Asian-American kinfolk is particularly vile because the elderly are being targeted. More than an act of cowardice, violence against elders is nothing less than a violent assault on legacy, on memory, on the determination of a people to remain."
The discourse around (mostly white) queer people "claiming" Mitski's music while ignoring its meaning and how it relates to her experience as an asian american woman is super interesting.
It’s funny cause some Asian Americans will tweet some wild shit about people not advocating for their struggle and being ignorant about their history when they can’t even name one Asian American Activist Group during the civil rights era
v proud to see all my non Asian friends sharing the attacks and spreading awareness of what’s happening to the Asian American community

I'm an Asian-American. I'm a minority. I don't think it's hard to see the reason why we should #ConvictTrump. He is the most offensive person to his own country's people and only chaos has ensued from him since he took office. I never want see him in office again.
I kinda want to point out that most of the characters in Code Red are Asian and that I was inspired by these zines I got to read in my Asian American studies class but also I kinda don’t

"I’m a proud Asian, Asian American and Filipino American"

The last 3 days have had a huge uptick in support & solidarity posts from high profile ppl within & alongside the #AsianAmerican community. New hate crimes are being reported so fast that we can’t keep up. But arrests are being made. Awareness is shifting. Cautiously hopeful.
suddenly these ig pages are acting like they care about asian americans? ive never had a voice as a minority within a minority group & i can count on one hand how many times anyone has ever listened to my asian-american experience. its performative.

Okay this is the thing about famous Asian Americans offering private rewards. It completely takes agency away from the community. Asian American community orgs have been working on police alternatives here for ages.
You don’t give a shit about Asian-American violence due to covid-related hate crimes if you continue to normalize behavior that leads to perpetuating the pandemic longer than it needs to be.
